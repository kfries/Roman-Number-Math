# Roman-Number-Math

This is simply a demonstration project requested by Pillar Technologies as a condition of my potential employment.

This software has little actual value, but if someone finds it useful, I am sorry.

## Assignment
The assignment was to add and subtract Roman Numbers.

### Possible Solutions

  1. Convert Roman Numbers into Arabic, do the math, then convert back
  2. Find and code an actual algoritm to do the math actually with Roman Numbers
  
  **I find #1 above cheating** *The assignment was not to convert numbers into and out of Arabic, it was to perform math
  with Roman Numbers*

I selected Method #2 and followed the process outlined at: http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/math/how-to-add-and-subtract-roman-numerals?page=1
